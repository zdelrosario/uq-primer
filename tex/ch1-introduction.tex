\chapter{Introduction}
\lettrine[findent=2pt]{\textbf{W}}{illiam} Gibson's masterful short story
\emph{The Gernsback Continuum}\cite{gibson1986chrome} follows a man haunted by
an idea. His protagonist is pursued by \emph{semiotic ghosts}, lingering packets
of meaning, there in the form of ray-gun spacemen and ten-engine airships sprung
from the mind of legendary science fiction author Hugo Gernsback. This
character's dilemma is Gibson's reaction to the starry-eyed view of science
fiction in the 1970's -- a view stuck in the chrome-plated, streamlined future
of the 1930's which could never be.

We as engineers in the early 2000's are haunted by a different semiotic ghost,
that of an engineering certainty which never existed. Our tools are predicated
on a deterministic, omniscent view of the universe which is woefully at odds
with the reality of our occupation. Our traditional approach is to make
uncertainty irrelevant -- to pile on margin and arbitrary safety factors until
we creep away from failure, at the expense of inefficient, expensive designs,
and a lack of understanding of the relevant uncertainties.

This book is an attempt at exoricism. Rather than making it irrelevant, we aim
to \emph{Manage Uncertainty}.
